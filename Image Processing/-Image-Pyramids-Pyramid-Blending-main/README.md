# -Image-Pyramids-Pyramid-Blending
 This project focuses on image pyramids, low-pass and band-pass filtering, and their application in image blending. The main objectives include constructing Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, implementing pyramid blending, and comparing the blending results using different filters in the expand and reduce operations.

Pyramids serve as a technique for seamlessly blending two images by combining their corresponding pyramid levels. This involves blending the low-frequency components from one image with the high-frequency components from the other, resulting in a visually pleasing and smoothly blended image.
